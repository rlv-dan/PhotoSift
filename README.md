PhotoSift
=========

PhotoSift is a free utility helping you to quickly organize unsorted image libraries. The basic idea is to load the program with images, then show and inspect each image and press a key on the keyboard. The image will then be moved or copied to a folder of your choice corresponding to that key, and the next images is displayed. This allows you to rapidly go through and organize your large amounts of pictures.
